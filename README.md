# Fun Fitness Gym

The purpose of my project is to provide an website for a gym that is providing the public with a different way of exercising other then lifting weights and running on dreadmills.
The website's purpose is to both provide people with both a online way of signing up and showing people the different ways that we train which are both fun and have more benefits then your average local gym. 

### UX

#### User Stories

As a new user, I want the navigation bar to be organised well, so that I can navigate through the website with ease.

As a new customer, I want to see what the gym provides to me, so that I can partipate.

As a potential customer, I want to be able to sign up easily, so I can join the gym.

As a user, I want to be able to ask any questions I have, so I can improve my understanding of Fun Fitness.

The wireframes that were created in the design phase, have been included in the project under the directory 'Wireframes'.<br/>
Inside this folder I have included wireframes for a desktop, tablet and mobile phone screen.

#### Strategy
My aim for the design was to create a website that was easy to navigate around and access information, I also wanted an vibrant design to match the name of project.

#### Scope
I designed this website to show potential customers how our gym is different to others and the types of activites that we do.<br/> 
I also wanted a online way for customers to sign up so that we can get them ready to join quicker and how to contact us.

#### Structure
The way I have structured my project is to have the sign up form on the home page so that customer can find it with ease and be able to join.<br/>
In the 'Why Join' page, I have listed a summary of joining the gym at the top of the page and then listed the different benefits side by side that we provide.<br/>
The next page is solely based on diffrent activites that the gym provides, the page is set up with a image of the activity with a brief description of why to join and what days the activites are done.<br/>
The last page is the 'Contact Us' page, this is set up with the contact, timings and address details at the top of the page side by side and below is a questions form.<br/>
#### Skeleton
I have included the wireframes in my project on different devices such as desktop, tablet and mobile.

#### Surface
I have used a light blue color for the background of my header and footer and used white color for the text to create a fun and vibrant style, also I have chose to stick with a white background in the section background as it is the best color to match the header and footer.

### Technologies Used

#### HTML
This was one of the langauges used to build the website and input the text.
#### CSS
This was the second language used to style the pages of the website
#### [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
This was used to help structure the pages in my website.
#### [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
This libary was used to include icons in my project.
#### [HoverCSS](https://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
This libary was used to hover when over the links in the navbar and footer.
#### [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com/)
This tool was used to include different fonts on my webpages.


### Testing

#### [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
I used this website to test my css file, there were no errors on the file.

#### [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) 
I used this website to test my html files. There were errors in the files, such as there was a missing closing div in the footer which was the main error on the files as there were missing closing divs in sections for the 'index' and 'why-join' file.
Another error was that the benefits list on the why join file was written as a unordered list, but there were information for each list item so it needs to be listed as a description list which has been rectified.

#### 1. Easy Use of Navigation Bar 
The navbar is very simply with four links, which will take you to the page your require<br/>such as if you want to go to the why join page all you need to do is click on the why join link in the navbar and if you would like to visit the home page you can just click on the home link in the navbar or the title of the website and it will take you back to that main page.

#### 2. I want to see what the gym provides to me 
A new customer's user story will be achieved by going to the why join page and reading the benefits they'll recieve and they can go on the activities page to see what activity's interest them.

#### 3. Easy Sign Up
A potential customer's user story will be achieved as the sign up form is on the home page so the user is able to find it and join with ease.
If you try to submit the form without filling in all fields which are 'First Name', 'Surname' and 'Email Address' then a pop up will appear to state that all fields need to be complete, this was done by adding 'Required' attribute.<br/>
If all fields have been filled then the webpage will reload.  

#### 4. I want to be able to ask any questions I have
A user's story will be achieved by going to the 'Contact Us' page and then going towards the bottom of the page and the user can ask any question.
If the user attempts to submit the form without completing all fields then the form won't submit, the 'Required' attribute has been added to all the fields 'Full Name, 'Email Address' and the 'Question' to make this happened.
If all fields are filled then the webpage will reload. 

##### Websites & Devices Testing 
This website was tested on different devices such as the Iphone 6/7/8, Ipad Pro and Ipad and on multiple websites such as Google Chrome, Internet Exployer and Firefox to make sure that it was responsive and compatible.
During the testing phase for this I need to fix the navbar as it wasnt't fitting on page on the devices and the links were overlapping each other, this was corrected so the navbar is in a square when in this size with two links at the top and two below. 
Another issue I found was the footer would not stay at the bottom on desktop screens larger then laptops and the Ipad Pro, but I have rectified this know by using the bootstrap grid to rearrange when on these screens.
I also found that the 'Contact Us' link in the navbar wasn't sitting properly when it was on a mobile screen such as the Samsung S5 or the Google Pixel, this has been sorted by placing the navbar vertical when on mobile screens.
